# 📌 Overview

Potato crops are highly vulnerable to diseases such as **Early Blight** and **Late Blight**, which can significantly reduce crop yield if not detected early.

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow** to classify potato leaf images into:

- 🟢 Healthy
- 🟤 Early Blight
- ⚫ Late Blight

The application provides a clean web interface where users can upload a leaf image and receive an instant prediction with confidence score and disease information.
